# hypeReduce
Simple State Management

```
npm i hypereduce
```

```
import { hypeReduce } from 'hypereduce'
```

------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that managing application state should be simple - yet powerful.
That's why we built hypeReduce.

hypeReduce takes the initial state of an application along with a reducer for managing state changes.

Unlike reducers in Redux, the hypeReduce reducer is just an object - making state management easier to  
visualise and manage.

Under the hood though, hypeReduce is built on the same reducer based structure of Redux.

```javascript

hypeReduce(initialState, reducer)

```

consider:

Our application state looks like

```javaScript

const initialState = {
  view: {
    ui: {
      field1: {
        text: 'hello world'
      }
    }
  }
}

```

To make 'hello world' updatable, we create a reducer which follows the initial state pretty closely.  
The difference being that 'hello world' has been replaced with CHANGE_TEXT.

```javaScript

const reducer = {
  view: {
    ui: {
      field1: {
        text: {
          CHANGE_TEXT
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

CHANGE_TEXT is a reference to a thing called an action-function.  
Action-functions are functions that handle actions.  
They take the previous state at the given node - in this case 'hello world' along with an action-object (aka an action).

For example, here's our CHANGE_TEXT action function.

```javascript
const CHANGE_TEXT = (state, action) =>
  action.payload || state
```

You can see that if the action parameter has a field called 'payload' then action.payload will be returned.  
Otherwise the original state is returned instead.

Now when we dispatch a CHANGE_TEXT action...

```javaScript

dispatch({
  type: 'CHANGE_TEXT',
  payload: 'new text'
})

```

hypeReduce matches the action.type of 'CHANGE_TEXT' to the node in the reducer that references CHANGE_TEXT.  
Since there is a match, the state at the given node - 'hello world' is passed into the action-function's state parameter.  
The action itself is passed into the action-function's action parameter.  
The response from the action-function becomes the new state at the given node.

boom ðŸ’¥


```javaScript

// new state

{
  view: {
    ui: {
      field1: {
        text: 'new text'
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## How Reducers work

When an action is dispatched it enters the top of the reducer.
The root-reducer is likely to have a number of child-nodes aka child-reducers.

The action is passed into each of these child-reducers.

If on a given node, their is an action-function reference that matches the action.type then that action-function fires.
Once the action function fires, the new state is returned for that given node.

If an action-function isn't triggered and that child-reducer has more child-reducers, 
then the action is passed into each of those.

The process continues until each reducer that gets passed an action returns their new state.

## Responding to different types of Actions

Just list the action functions under the given node

```
...
field1: {
  text: {
    CHANGE_TEXT,
    REVERSE_TEXT
  }
}
...

```

## Routing an Action-Function reference to a reusable Action Function

```javascript
...
field1: {
  text: {
    REPLACE_FIELD1: REPLACE
  }
}
...

```


## $ Wildcards

Need to respond to any action at a given node? - use $ and pass into a Reusable Action Function

```javascript
...
field1: {
  text: {
    $: MY_ACTION_FUNCTION
  }
}
...

```

Now any actions that make their way to the node with a $ will automatically trigger the corresponding action-function.

## Passdowns

When an action-function isn't triggered at a higher node, use _ to pass the action down into child nodes.

```javascript

field1: {
  DISABLE_FIELD,
  ENABLE_FIELD,
  _: {
    text: {
      CHANGE_TEXT,
      REVERSE_TEXT
    }
  }
}

```

## Reactive entry-points

We can listen for changes at a given node with the 'connect annotation' in the reducer, along with the `connect` function in our app.
We call these **Reactive Entrypoints**.

```javascript

const reducer = {
  view: {
    ui: {
      field1: {
        text: {
          connect: 'field1Text',
          CHANGE_TEXT
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// ... somewhere else in your app

import { connect } from 'hypereduce'

connect('field1Text', emittedValue => {
  console.log(emittedValue)
})

```

Now when an action is triggered on the above 'text' node, this will emit the new state to the `connect` listener.

Unlike 'subscribe' in other frameworks, `connect` can only be registered once on a given node. 
This is to reduce the panalty that exist in other frameworks when forgetting to unsubscribe from a subscribe.
In saying that we provide an `disconnect` function still for unregistering a connect.

```javascript
disconnect('field1Text')
```

## State-Shape & Component-Shape

The trick to bypassing this 'single connection' limitation is to match the state-shape to the component-shape of the application. 
In other words, the application state should match the components and therefore a state-node should only need to connect to
a single point in a component structure.

If two (or more) components reference the same piece of data, then the best practice way to do hanlde this is to:

Use a single-source-of-truth node that holds the actual data. Other 'Satellite' nodes don't hold the actual data, but instead 
an id representing the data, that still respond to the same actions. By putting `connect` annotations on the satellite nodes, this lets
different parts of the application know that the single-source-of-truth has changed.

## React

Using with React ? We hope so...  
Take advantage of Reactive Entry Points

First add a 'connect' annotation at a given node

```javascript

field1: {
  text: {
    connect: 'field1Text',
    CHANGE_TEXT
  }
}

```

Then in the corresponding component, use connect to listen for actions on that node

```jsx

import { connect, getStore, dispatch } from 'hypereduce'

const Text = () => {
  // useState is a React hook that allows you to update a component when a given piece of state changes.
  // getStore is a hypeReduce util that gets you the current hypeReduce stored state
  const [state, set] = useState(getStore().field1.text)
  // useEffect is another React hook, which fires on each render.
  // This calls connect which listens for actions on the 'field1Text' node
  // When this fires we call `set` which updates the state of this component.
  // The returned function inside `useEffect` calls `disconnect` which unregisters the 
  // component from listening for actions on the 'field1Text' node.
  // This function is called before each render AND when the component dismounts.
  useEffect(() => {
    connect('field1Text', emittedValue =>
      set(emittedValue)
    )
    return () => disconnect('field1Text')
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{ state }</h1>
      <button onClick={ ev => dispatch(
        {
          type: 'CHANGE_TEXT',
          payload: 'New text'
        }
      )}>push</button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

If you want to emit a node whenever state changes (and not only when an action is triggered on a node) then 
just annotate the state node with 'passiveConnect' instead of 'connect'. As long as the action makes it to the node in question, then the state of that node will be emitted.

Note the difference with passiveConnect vs $

- passiveConnect will emit the state of the given node whenever any action occurs.
- $ will run a corresponding action-function, whenever any action occurs.

To get started with React + hypeReduce

```javascript

const mount = document.getElementById('app')

hypeReduce(initState, reducer)

ReactDOM.render(
  firstComponent(),
  mount
)

```

## urlState

The state of the url is not forgotten in hypeReduce.

Upon initial load, the urlState is merged into your initial state.
If you were to log the state of your first-paint, it would have a key called `route` which would contain the urlState.

So a url of 'yoursite.com/cats/123?filter=on&show=cute-cats' would produce

Something like...

```javascript

{
  ...,
  route: {
    segments: [
      '',
      'cats',
      '123'
    ],
    queryString: {
      filter: 'on',
      show: 'cute-cats'
    }
  }
}

```

Whenever urlState changes, it triggers a ROUTE_CHANGE action.
The action looks like the following...

```javascript

{
  type: 'ROUTE_CHANGE,
  segments: [
    '',
    'cats',
    '123'
  ],
  queryString: {
    filter: 'on',
    show: 'cute-cats'
  }
}

```

The url is spit into segments and any queryString parameters are exposed as a key / value map.

To ensure that your app always has knowledge of current urlState, we suggest adding a route key + ROUTE_CHANGE action-function to your hypeReduce reducer like so...

```javascript

{
  route: { ROUTE_CHANGE }
}

```

hypeReduce provides the ROUTE_CHANGE action-function out-of-the-box

hypeReduce also provides the goto util which allows you to trigger a route change from a component.

```javascript

onClick={ () => goto('/cats') }

```

To create a link component, something like this should do the trick...

```javascript

const Link = ({ link, children }) =>
  <button onCick={ () => goto(link) }>{children}</button>

```

## Routing

Routing in hypeReduce is straight forward.

Lets say we have two views set up, and an initial state...

```javascript

  const view1 = 'Hi Im view 1'
  const view2 = 'Hi Im view 2'

  initialState = {
    view: {
      view1
    }
  }

```

We can create a simple router action-function that just changes the state to the new view.

```javascript

  const CHANGE_VIEW = (state, action) => {
    return (
      action.view === 'view2'
        ? { view2 }
        : { view1 }
    )
  }

```

The reducer contains the CHANGE_VIEW action-function that we created above.
Then in the passdown, we cater for both view1 and view2 in the reducer.

```javascript

  reducer = {
    view: {
      CHANGE_VIEW,
      _: {
        view1: {
          ...
        },
        view2: {
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }

```

And to change views...

```javascript

dispatch({ type: 'CHANGE_VIEW', view: 'view2' })

```

If we wanted to based our routing on the ROUTE_CHANGE action we can modify the reducer to...

```javascript

  reducer = {
    view: {
      ROUTE_CHANGE: CHANGE_VIEW,
      _: {
        view1: {
          ...
        },
        view2: {
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }

```

Now it calls CHANGE_VIEW whenever the ROUTE_CHANGE action is dispatched.

We can update our CHANGE_VIEW function to use the urlState that is passed through on ROUTE_CHANGE.
For example here we use the second url segment to route on.

```javascript

  const CHANGE_VIEW = (state, action) => {
    return (
      action.segments[1] === 'view2'
          ? { view2 }
          : { view1 }
    )
  }

```

## Reusability

hypeReduce is big on reusability.
By thinking of various parts of state as data-structures, we can often use the same functions.
We provide a bunch of functions out-of-the-box to get you started.

```javascript

field1: {
  text: {
    // REPLACE
    REPLACE_FIELD1: REPLACE
  }
}
// Replace text at field1
dispatch({
  type: 'REPLACE_FIELD1',
  payload: 'new text'
})

```

How about a collection of cats...

```javascript

const state = 
  cats: {
    byId: {
      cat1: {
        name: 'kitty'
      }
    },
    allIds: ['cat1']
  }

const reducer = {
  cats: {
    SET_CAT: SET,
    UPDATE_CAT: UPDATE,
    DELETE_CAT: DELETE
  }
}

// SET can be used to add new cats, or replace existing cats
dispatch({
  type: 'SET_CAT',
  id: 'cat2',
  payload: { name: 'garfield' }
})

// UPDATE allows you to specify a particular key of the collection item to update

dispatch({
  type: 'UPDATE_CAT',
  id: 'cat2',
  key: 'name',
  payload: 'garfield'
})

// DELETE allows you to well ... delete items

dispatch({
  type: 'DELETE_CAT',
  id: 'cat2'
})

```

## Dispatching multiple actions

Multiple Actions can be dispatched at once...

```javascript

dispatch(
  { type: 'ACTION1' },
  { type: 'ACTION2'}
)

```

All the actions will run in order before any state changes to `connect` listeners. 

## Asynchronous Actions

In hypeReduce - there should be NO asynchronous actions.
Action-functions should be pure functions that return a response synchronously.

Asynchronous operations should be handled outside of hypeReduce.

A common way to do this is to call a sequence that dispatches actions at intervals in an async operation...

```javascript

const sequence = () => {
  dispatch({ type: 'START_ASYNC_OP' })
  setTimeout(() => dispatch({ type: 'MIDDLE_ASYNC_OP' }), 1000)
  setTimeout(() => dispatch({ type: 'FINISH_ASYNC_OP' }), 2000)
}

```

It is also common to use `connect` to listen to a state change, that then triggers a dispatch...

```javascript

connect(
  'some-node',
  newValue => {
    dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_STATUS', status: 'done', value: newValue })
  }
)

```
